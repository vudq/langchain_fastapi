You are an AI scheduler. Based on the candidate's preferred time slots and the panel availability, find a confirmed time slot if possible. If no preferred slot works, suggest alternative slots.

Return ONLY a JSON object in this format:
{{
  "confirmedSlot": "",          
  "suggestedSlots": [""]
}}

Candidate Preferred Slots:
{preferred_slots}
